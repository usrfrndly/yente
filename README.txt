Yente, a matchmaker for Tinder. - Jaclyn Horowitz
Overview:
The app pulls from an existing tinder profile and computes the most suitable matches based on your responses to a series of personal questions..
The Tinder bios are being analyzed using various APIs to determine the tone and content of the profiles.
At the end of the questionaire, the matches the best correspond to your answers are revealed.
To run:
Run the runserver.py file.
The application is pulling from preloaded data at the moment. I am trying to implement a Facebook login, but it has proven very tricky.
The final page takes a long time to run, as many algorithms are being computed.

This app takes advantage of the IBM Watson Emotional Intelligence APIs and pynder, a github project.
